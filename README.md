Yellow Pages - Open Source Software Directory - Script - Free


Open Source Software Directory - Free and always will be 

It seems a bold design especially for those who are not web developer, which is my case, but I come hereby request the help of all the programmers who can have a bit of its precise time and help us to launch one of the boldest Business script Directory, there are many on the market however most are not many paid programs as I do not have milheres of dollars to invest, then decide to seek people who have the ability to work to throws a yellow page script similar to yellowpages.com 

and those who are not codição can start your online directories in a few clicks, however free. 

The idea of the project conciste in: 

Database: mysql 
Programming language: PHP 
Style Sheets: CSS 
among other options. 

Sincerely; 
Antonio Marcos - Founder
